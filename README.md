# Variable-Recognizer

<p> This simple program recorgnizes whether name of variable is correct or not based on C/C++ language </p>
<p> There are details for my working model(two figures) below  </p>

## My thought
Actually making recorgnizer is so simple if we know the model which is called state transition table.
I think that important thing is how to think the proper model to solve given problem. that was state transition table in this case.

<b> I realized that Regular expression is not magic anymore. </b>
<b> Many state machine model is built in Regular expression so we can use the models well defined to solve given problem because this is more impact algorithm in usual case. </b>
